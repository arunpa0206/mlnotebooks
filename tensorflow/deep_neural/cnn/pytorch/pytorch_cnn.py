# PyTorch 1.2 Quickstart with Google Colab
In this code tutorial we will learn how to quickly train a model to understand some of PyTorch's basic building blocks to train a deep learning model. This notebook is inspired by the ["Tensorflow 2.0 Quickstart for experts"](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/quickstart/advanced.ipynb#scrollTo=DUNzJc4jTj6G) notebook.

After completion of this tutorial, you should be able to import data, transform it, and efficiently feed the data in batches to a convolution neural network (CNN) model for image classification.

"""## Import The Data
The first step before training the model is to import the data. We will use the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) which is like the Hello World dataset of machine learning.

Besides importing the data, we will also do a few more things:
- We will tranform the data into tensors using the `transforms` module
- We will use `DataLoader` to build convenient data loaders or what are referred to as iterators, which makes it easy to efficiently feed data in batches to deep learning models.
- As hinted above, we will also create batches of the data by setting the `batch` parameter inside the data loader. Notice we use batches of `32` in this tutorial but you can change it to `64` if you like. I encourage you to experiment with different batches.

                                          shuffle=True, num_workers=2)

"""## Exploring the Data
As a practioner and researcher, I am always spending a bit of time and effort exploring and understanding the dataset. It's fun and this is a good practise to ensure that everything is in order.

Let's check what the train and test dataset contains. I will use `matplotlib` to print out some of the images from our dataset.

"""## The Model
Now using the classical deep learning framework pipeline, let's build the 1 convolutional layer model.

Here are a few notes for those who are beginning with PyTorch:
- The model below consists of an `__init__()` portion which is where you include the layers and components of the neural network. In our model, we have a convolutional layer denoted by `nn.Conv2d(...)`. We are dealing with an image dataset that is in a grayscale so we only need one channel going in, hence `in_channels=1`. We hope to get a nice representation of this layer, so we use `out_channels=32`. Kernel size is 3, and for the rest of parameters we use the default values which you can find [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=conv2d#conv2d).
- We use 2 back to back dense layers or what we refer to as linear transformations to the incoming data. Notice for `d1` I have a dimension which looks like it came out of nowhere. 128 represents the size we want as output and the (`26*26*32`) represents the dimension of the incoming data. If you would like to find out how to calculate those numbers refer to the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html?highlight=linear#conv2d). In short, the convolutional layer transforms the input data into a specific dimension that has to be considered in the linear layer. The same applies for the second linear transformation (`d2`) where the dimension of the output of the previous linear layer was added as `in_features=128`, and `10` is just the size of the output which also corresponds to the number of classes.
- After each one of those layers, we also apply an activation function such as `ReLU`. For prediction purposes, we then apply a `softmax` layer to the last transformation and return the output of that.

"""**EXERCISE:** As a way to practise, try to include the testing part inside the code where I was outputing the training accuracy, so that you can also keep testing the model on the testing data as you proceed with the training steps. This is useful as sometimes you don't want to wait until your model has completed training to actually test the model with the testing data.

## Final Words
That's it for this tutorial! Congratulations! You are now able to implement a basic CNN model in PyTorch for image classification. If you would like, you can further extend the CNN model by adding more convolution layers and max pooling, but as you saw, you don't really need it here as results look good. If you are interested in implementing a similar image classification model using RNNs see the references below.
